INSTRUCTIONS:

First file PCA.py is for dimensionality reduction. It will create two files PCA_train_result.csv and PCA_test_result.csv

These two files are used by LogisticReg.py to run the classifier. LogisticReg.py will produce predicted_labels.

STEP 1: Run PCA.py
STEP 2: Run LogisticReg.py
